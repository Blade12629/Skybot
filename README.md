Currently Features:

- Analyzer
- Statistics:
- - Top list for Players and Teams
- - Detailed Info about specific matches, players and teams
- - Player and Team ratings (ratings are not calculated based on the map difficulty but based on the performance someone did vs how the other players performed in a match)
- Bind bot permissions (like VIP, admin etc.) to discord roles!
- Verification
- API (WIP)
- Server Management commands (like !mute)

- And much more to come!
